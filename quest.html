            special quests are significant adventures undertaken by demigods, often involving perilous challenges and encounters with mythical creatures. Quests are designed to test the abilities, bravery, and teamwork of the demigods. They often involve retrieving important artifacts, rescuing someone, or defeating powerful enemies. Quests can be assigned by camp leaders, such as Chiron, or directly from the gods. Sometimes, demigods volunteer for quests, particularly if they feel a personal connection to the mission.During their journeys, demigods encounter various obstacles, including riddles, traps, and battles with mythological creatures (like monsters or antagonistic gods).

            Successfully completing a quest often leads to personal growth for the characters, helping them discover their strengths and forge lasting friendships. Failure can result in dire consequences, including loss or injury. After completing a quest, demigods often share their experiences, learn valuable lessons, and reflect on how they’ve changed.
