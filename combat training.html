        Sparring: Campers often train by dueling each other to improve their techniques and strategies.
        Team Formation: Training includes team strategies, such as how to work together in groups when facing enemies.
        <br>
        3. Monster Fighting
        Occasionally, training involves fighting predetermined monsters to gain hands-on experience.
        <br>
        4. Physical Training
        Physical fitness exercises are conducted to ensure demigods are in optimal condition for combat, including endurance, strength, and agility training.
        <br>
        5. Mentors and Trainers
        Campers are often trained by older campers or even gods/goddesses, who provide direct tips and guidance.
        <br>
        6. Simulation Training
        There are simulation sessions using various tools and equipment to create realistic combat scenarios.
        <br>
        7. Magical Techniques
